\subsubsection{Description}\label{description}}

Since the arrival of sound in cinema in the late 1920s, musical
soundtracks have been a key aesthetic element in the history of cinema.
This course explores the rich history of cinematic soundtracks, from the
pianists that accompanied early silent cinema to the recent popularity
of live soundtrack performances at screenings of silent classics such
as~\emph{The Black Pirate}. Topics include the symphonic music of the
``Hollywood Sound''; cartoon music, from~\emph{Merrie Melodies}~to Walt
Disney's~\emph{Fantasia}; jazz and~\emph{film noir}; electronic music in
1950s sci-fi movies; Bernard Herrmann's collaborations with Alfred
Hitchcock; the French New Wave soundtracks of Georges Delerue and Michel
Legrand; the psychedelic movies of The Beatles and The Monkees; the
soundtracks of Ennio Morricone and Lalo Schifrin; the progressive rock
soundtracks of the art cinema of Michelangelo Antonioni and Werner
Herzog; and the Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu's collaboration with
Akira Kurosawa.

Begininng in Week 2, each class session will be divided into two halves,
with a short break between each. In the first half, we'll discuss a
chapter from Part One of the course textbook (\textbf{Techniques \&
Meaning}); in the second half, we'll discuss a chapter from Part Three
(\textbf{Critical Analysis}).

Each week beginning in week 2, a group of three students will be
assigned to host a 30-minute discussion of the reading assignment in the
first half of class (i.e., there will be one group in the first half and
a different group in the second half). Group assignments are made
randomly.
